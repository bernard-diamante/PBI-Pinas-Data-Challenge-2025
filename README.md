## Notes:
- **TAT skew**: 2018–2020 average turnaround time may be unreliable due to small samples and outliers; excluded from the TAT visual.
- **Delayed projects**: Includes all projects past their planned completion date. Over-budget projects cannot directly be determined from the data but can be inferred from completion delays.
- **Joint ventures**: Contract value is split equally among partner contractors.
- **Data coverage**: Reflects all DPWH projects in the provided dataset.
- **Missing data**: ₱162B in Flood Control Projects have no recorded contractor; this significantly impacts contractor-level totals.
- **Contractor focus**: Besides contractors with the highest awarded value, review those with the largest budget tied to delayed projects.
- **Cleaned data**: Projects from non-DPWH implementing offices were removed.
- **Scalabilit**y: A star schema was used to improve clarity, performance, and future expansion.
